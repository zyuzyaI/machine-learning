# Colour Detection using Pandas & OpenCV

In this color detection project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.

For work we will be need OpenCV and pandas.
