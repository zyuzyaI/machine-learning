And there are brown cats.\nThere are black dogs. And there are black cats.\nAnd certainly a dog and cat could appear in the same environment (such as a house, park, beach, etc.) where the background color distributions are similar.\nBecause of this, utilizing strictly color is not a great choice for characterizing the difference between dogs and cats — but that’s okay.
