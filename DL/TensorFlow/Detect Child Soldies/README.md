In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and OpenCV to identify potential child soldiers through automatic age detection and military fatigue recognition.

How can we detect and identify potential child soldiers with computer vision and deep learning?

Detecting and identifying potential child soldiers is a four-step process:

1. Step #1 – Face Detection: Apply [face detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) to localize faces in the input images/video streams 

2. Step #2 – Age Detection: Utilize [deep learning-based age detectors](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/04/13/opencv-age-detection-with-deep-learning/) to determine the age of the person detected via Step #1

3. Step #3 – Military Fatigue Detection: Apply deep learning to [automatically detect camouflage or other indications of a military uniform](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/04/27/fine-tuning-resnet-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/)

4. Step #4 – Combine Results: Take the results from Step #2 and Step #3 to determine if a child is potentially wearing military fatigues, which may be an indication of a child soldier, depending on the origin and context of the original image
