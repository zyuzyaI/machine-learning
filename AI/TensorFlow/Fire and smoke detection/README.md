[sourse](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/11/18/fire-and-smoke-detection-with-keras-and-deep-learning/)

The dataset we’ll be using for fire and smoke examples was curated by PyImageSearch reader, Gautam Kumar.

Guatam gathered a total of 1,315 images by searching Google Images for queries related to the term “fire”, “smoke”, etc.

The dataset we’ll be using for Non-fire examples is called 8-scenes as it contains 2,688 image examples belonging to eight natural scene categories (all without fire):

* Coast
* Mountain
* Forest
* Open country
* Street
* Inside city
* Tall buildings
* Highways
